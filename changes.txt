LIB nesdoug.s changed to allow 256 metatiles

NES_ST saved new metatile file
meta.py now outputs file with .h extension, same name as input file,
and the array name is the same as input file
you can #include it directly to the main .h or .c file.

took new photo of the metatile screen, import to Tiled, tested a few of the new blocks
saved to BG folder new room1

crt0.s changed to add a few more library variables.
META_PTR2 and META_VAR

edited metatiles.c to manually add 3 single metatiles to test buffer_1_mt
...looks like green UU YY and brick at the top of the screen.
(you can't collide with them, we didn't change the collision map)
